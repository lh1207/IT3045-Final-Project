Contemporary Programming IT3045C Final Project
"# IT3045-Final-Project" 

This repository is a Swagger UI back-end system that stores student information and allows for edits to be made.

This project was locally programmed via Visual Studio and my local drive; I unfortunately did not push the code here or make any commits until the project was finished as it wasn't a requirement for the assignment.
